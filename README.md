# Transcriptome based alternative splicing analysis in four tissues in beef cattle
BAM files aligned from RNA-Seq raw files of rumen, liver, muscle, and backfat tissues are used to generate BED files and then to be investigated junction expression and alternative splicing events using Multipath-PSI algorithm. Other related analyze code such as WGCNA are also included.
